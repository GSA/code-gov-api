It relies on the multiprocess support included in Java Pathfinder (JPF) which provides basic functionality to verify the bytecode of distributed applications. JPF-NAS is implemented as a JPF extension which models interprocess communication mechanisms. It uses a form of partial order reduction to explore all possible executions of a distributed Java application. Moreover, JPF-NAS provides a functionality to check the given distributed application under test against possible network failures which can occur at the operating system or the hardware layer.",

The system includes a load-balancing client, a lightweight data server, scripts for collecting system load, and scripts for analyzing user behavior. Because Ballast is invoked as part of the SSH login process, it has access to user names. This capability, which is not available in traditional approaches, enables Ballast to perform user-specific load balancing. In addition, Ballast is easy to install, induces near-zero overhead, and has fault-tolerant features in its architectures that will eliminate single points of failure.",

The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. The program works by reading test data files and determining maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of random loading spectra in order to calculate theoretical crack growth. The innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.",

This object-oriented framework will integrate the analysis codes for multiple disciplines, instead of relying on one code to perform the analysis for all disciplines. Optimization can then take place within each discipline module, or in a loop between the central executive module and the discipline modules, or both. This version uses  a public-domain optimization code, Automated Design Synthesis (ADS) version 1.10, instead of using the DOT code.  We tested this updated version using couple of sample test problems. The public domain code, ADS version 1.10, was developed by Vanderplaats using NASAs budget around 1984.",

It includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m) using elements such as 12 DOF plates and 6 DOF beams. The aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a PID control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots determined using the K-method are also included. The code is commented for Graduate and Undergraduate students of aeroservoelasticity who want to know the basic concepts of medium fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. Not all methods are coded to industry standards. But students of the field including practicing engineers may find it useful for basic understanding; theoretical manuals for industry level codes tend to leave out many of the coding details. All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most of it is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications with one focusing on V&V with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data are also included.",

      "description": "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.\r\n\r\nmagnetic bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance.",

ETA Tool can provide an assessment of the modeled system based on diagnostic metrics of detectability and failure isolation. The program can provide assessment of a system's detection coverage, test utilization, failure isolation at the root cause or at the component levels, generate a FMEA Report, perform sensor sensitivity studies and provide a trace-mapping of failure modes to higher level system effects. ETA Tool generates reports from each selected analysis option in both an HTML and XML format to enable user access in either standard web browsers or loadable into an Microsoft Excel workbook for review/editing.",

The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited",

      "description": "A calculational procedure has been designed and implemented in software that enables the specification and design of a space-based optical communications system.  The resulting optical link budget essentially accounts for the communication power flow through the entire optical communications channel from the transmitter to the receiver and yields design specifications for the optical system necessary to assure reliable data transmission with desired operational metrics such as data rate, link margin, etc.  The link budget takes into account all the sources of deleterious noise that enters into the communications process such as electronically generated noise in the optical detector and stray optical irradiance from external sources.  The link budget has the capability of being interfaced with the orbital element calculations of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to allow the dynamic description and evolution of optical link operation from any space-borne satellite within the solar system to and from the earth.",

OpenMDAO is the open source framework developed by NASA that will be accessible via an open source website to reach the entire broad based MDAO community to facilitate advancing the science of MDAO.  MDAO covers a vast set of capabilities, including a flexible framework and state of the art discipline codes.  This innovation relates specifically to the framework.  OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.  Currently, the OpenMDAO version 0.1 functionalities include component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves, the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications, error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs), plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing support.  To be clear, the framework will enable the integration of, but will not include: optimizers, solvers, visualization tools, custom data types, script components, and discipline codes.  AEROSPACE:  To meet the present and future economic and environmental challenges facing air transportation, aviation design must expand its focus from today's conventional \"wing-body-tail\" aircraft to more advanced vehicles.   The ability to design revolutionary aircraft to improve mobility and air transport efficiency is of paramount importance to the national economy, along with reducing our environmental impact and supporting national defense.   Technologies such as the one disclosed here incorporate progressively more sophisticated computational models and methods, enabling future aircraft designs today.",

Viscous effects, and heat transfer effects are modeled using source terms.  The effects of potential inlet flow reversals are modeled using boundary conditions.

This system uses a single, industry-standard protocol, to ease integration with other products, and uses both COTS, GOTS and public domain software to form a single, cohesive system. It is composed of several parts:\r\n\r\nThe Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Testing (ASIST) is the user-interface, providing user with the ability to view and analyze telemetry, send commands, and automate tests. The Front End Data System reads telemetry from spacecrafts, distributing requested data packets to subscribing clients; additionally, it controls the forward (command) link to the spacecraft, formatting command packets so that the spacecraft can read them and verifying that commands are transferred correctly. The Digital History Data Store (DHDS) archives the raw telemetry received from the spacecraft and distributes historical telemetry data to clients.\r\n\r\nThis system can be configured in a number of ways. For small labs, a single ASIST workstation may be used, while in I&T or mission operations, the configuration may include up to 31 ASIST workstations. All configurations provide the user with the same standard interface to their flight hardware.",

The application developer uses GRASP interface libraries and device drivers to interact with external hardware. Should a new hardware item require a driver, that development would be part of GRASP and would be added to the GRASP interface libraries and become available for future projects. GRASP application software is developed by using the GRASP template, which offers access to the services GRASP provides. The templated generic code handles process initialization, thread creation, inter-process messaging, process health monitoring, data logging, data distribution, etc., with hooks that provide for subsystem tailoring. Using GRASP allows application developers to concentrate on mission specifics, reducing development time, cost, and risk.",

Each investigation team generally tackles these challenges independently and reach various plateaus of performance that are well below those that are theoretically and demonstrably achievable. At the same time, pseudospectral algorithms have many unique characteristics that limit the applicability/efficacy of many software frameworks used by the high performance computing community. Such characteristics include \"transposes\" - large redistributions of data across an entire computing platform, nontrivial computational domains (e.g. spherical harmonic modes), little-or-no nearest-neighbor communication, and high computational intensity (DGEMM, FFT, etc). The goals of SpF (Spectral Framework) are to (1) reduce complexity and duplication of effort across multiple investigation teams, (2) achieve near optimal scalability on existing computing architectures (10\"4-10\"5 cores), (3) provide automation for domain decomposition and load balancing that circumvent hardwired constraints in existing applications, (4) provide automated and optimized global data \"transpososes\" that dominate compute time for large problems, (5) provide access to optimized numerical libraries including libraries implemented on hardware accelerators, and (6) provide a flexible/optimized input/output layer.",

The NOS Common software applications were designed to be project agnostic and flexible to support any implementation.  The most notable utilities include the NOS logging and NOS utils libraries.  The NOS logging library is a lightweight and easy-to-use logging framework.  The NOS util library is an all-purpose library to house various generic solutions to common development problems.  These include generic pooling mechanism, a specialized threading pool, and a custom assert mechanism.  The threading pool allows cross-platform thread management to any application or library with very low user interaction.  The custom assert mechanism is designed to not have certain error checking implementations removed during compile time under release configurations. ",

It is a key piece of the planned Interplanetary Internet.  The basic idea is that BP is given bundles to deliver, and it delivers them to their specified destination, using the appropriate route.  For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center.  For each hop along the way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol.  For example, to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp).  Generally, the lower-level protocol is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops).\r\n\r\nThe Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission designers.   It has been developed for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission and the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) group.  It is useful for any organization (commercial or otherwise) that is interested in being part of the Interplanetary Internet.",

It distributes commands to, and collects data from, all spacecraft subsystems and  the science instruments.  The FSW controls high gain antenna pointing to TDRSS satellites and manages communications with the ground controllers in real time to receive commands (during SSA contacts) and send housekeeping telemetry data during SSA and MA contacts.  It sends science data using the Class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).  The GPM FSW monitors the health of  most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.  \r\nThe GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power,  and the pointing of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS.   The GPM FSW uses the propulsion system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion.  The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform \"yaw maneuvers\" to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees.\r\nThe GPM FSW uses Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission use.\r\n",

The constraint on the integers is added to the solution as a measurement with infinite precision. This software introduces a new method.

Combining both the retrieval and simulation tasks in a single piece of software makes it far easier to ensure that identical forward model algorithms and parameters are used in both tasks and dramatically reduces the complexity of the code maintenance effort. The unique features of this software lies with the instrument and its unique capabilities to measure the atmospheric temperatures and composition at the earth's limb.",

The tool serves as a single application that will maintain guest and mission information, run standard reports, email guests, produce mailing labels, and export data. Via the Internet, invited guests can access EGO Web pages from all over the world to register their attendance intentions, access relevant mission data, and update their contact information. After guest registration, administrative support personnel have used EGO to maintain guest-seating assignments, send email communications, maintain attendance to special receptions, and gather security information for foreign guests. EGO replaces a very paper-intensive process, saves a significant amount in postage costs, and reduces error-prone data entry. The tool has been built with flexibility and customization in mind. Its initial scope was broadened to also serve as the login for people invited to view an International Space Station Friends and Family Web site created by Wyle Life Sciences. The Constellation program also used EGO to invite guests to attend the Pad Abort (PA-1) test flight in 2010.",

STAT overcomes problems with scoping by linking up meaningful phrases that could be separated by text (e.g., \"not aligned\" versus \"not completely aligned\"). STAT's use of hierarchical ontologies overcomes the limitations of data codes, which are flat, closed, and have small sets of values that are often difficult to interpret. The ontology organizes aerospace terminology in hierarchies of types of problems, properties, objects, and functions. The tool identifies and tags types of problems and equipment mentioned in text fields, thereby providing new data files for record keeping. These new data files support text mining and clustering, report generation, browsing, and search at various levels of abstraction.",

Martin Marietta Corp. developed the program, called UD233A, for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. DSS was used to study performance of parachute descent of flight test vehicle versions of the NASA Orion space craft. DSS incorporates 6 degrees of translational and rotational motion for both the vehicle and attached parachute, It models the deployment and inflation of the parachute system. DSS has separate aerodynamic and mass properties for both the vehicle and parachute.\r\nDSS is an in-house analysis tool. As such there is little documentation on the modifications made to UD233A to create DSS.\r\n",

This will be accomplished by:\r\nA graphical component-connection model is created by arranging and connecting components selected from the Master Equipment list.\r\n\r\nFor each component, a pick-list user interface asks a few questions to narrow down potential failure modes.  This uses a failure mode library in MS Excel based on standard failure modes and associated component functions and features.\r\n\r\nPick-lists for types failure mode causes and immediate effects help the analyst complete initial draft FMEA worksheets, which link to the components in the model.\r\n\r\nThe graphical model, which is marked with redundant components and paths, shows upstream/downstream dependencies, to help the analyst add further effects and criticality to the FMEA worksheets.\r\n\r\nThis tool is innovative because it saves analysis time and provides a standardized and systematic approach in failure analysis, thereby enabling risk mitigation early in system design.  There are also potential benefits of tool use during the operations phase to identify the cause(s) of a fault or failure.   \r\n",

Actions include deploying the parachute, changing the reefing on the parachute, and cutting away the parachute.  Multiple chutes can be deployed at any given time, but all chutes in that case are assumed to behave as individually isolated chutes; there is no modeling of any interactions between deployed chutes.  Drag characteristics of a deployed chute are based on a coefficient of drag, the face-area of the chute, and the local dynamic pressure only.  The orientation of the chute is approximately modeled for purposes of obtaining torques on the vehicle, but the dynamic state of the chute as a separate entity is not integrated, the treatment is simply an approximation. \r\n\r\nPlans for every post-shuttle manned vehicle which will reenter Earth's atmosphere, or for that matter, the Martian atmosphere, include a descent phase controlled by some sort of parachute system.  Having a NASA-certified parachute model which can be plugged into various flight simulators is a huge advantage.  Building a special purpose parachute simulator for a specific simulation is at least a million dollar job.  Lockheed Martin had to do exactly that in order to support Pad Abort I, and GFEChutes Lo-Fi was tested against the Lockheed prototype.  \r\n\r\nHaving a verified, Class C parachute model, packaged in a reusable (plug-and-play) form, is smart technically and an outstanding strategic move as we enter the world of commercial manned space flight.

      "description": "The code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks) has been developed over the last years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of ionizing radiations at the microscopic scale and to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a step-by-step diffusion-reaction program based on the Greens functions of the diffusion equation. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs. ",

The particle tracking is based on the particle's mass properties and local aerodynamic characteristics within the flowfield.  The software allows the user to specify the location and initial conditions for release of the particle.  The code then traces the particle's ballistic trajectory (i.e. any lift force is ignored) through the grid system.  The resulting trajectory is output to a file which can be viewed/processed as needed by the user.\r\n\r\nThe DEBRIS software was created to accurately and efficiently analyze the debris transport environment for liberated debris from the Space Shuttle Launch Vehicle (SSLV) during ascent.  The motivation for its development is a consequence of the Columbia accident, where foam used to insulate the external tank dislodged during ascent and struck the wing leading edge of the Orbiter.  The resulting impact critically breached the thermal protection system for the wing, allowing hot gases to enter the structure of the vehicle, which led to the catastrophic loss of crew and vehicle.\r\n",

Since not all missions are long enough to payback the mass of the recycling hardware, or may not need all possible resources that could be recycled, determining the best suite of technologies to provide the right amount of resource recovery for each mission is very difficult.  Because so many technological combinations are possible, the development of an Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) was created as a means to investigate these combinations. This tool assists in the determination of the most mass effective and reliable combination of methods available for a steady-state operating condition. ALSSAT has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program and has been programmed to perform multiple-case mission scenarios through Visual Basic (VB) interface forms for data input and computational analysis of ALS subsystems. Based on the preliminary design considerations, the Advanced Life Support system mass, power, and volume are computed for various mission specifications. The results can be used as a guide to select the best system architecture.",

Data and analyses of accelerations is important for phemomena and systems that are sensitive to gravity, such as multiphase fluid flow (e.g., gas and liquid concurrent flows).  These data measurements are required for parabolic, suborbital and/or space testing and operations to evaluate research and hardware under the dynamic and different test/operational environment in zero- and/or low-gravity. The current data viewer configuration was developed using the COTS Labview Runtime Engine executable available for free download from the National Instruments website (http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2012/3433/en/; http://ftp.ni.com/support/softlib/labview/labview_runtime/2012/Windows/LVRTE2012f3std.exe).  In addition, the viewer uses COTS apps for retrieval/transfer of data from an Apple iTouch into the customizable Labview program . Key features are the use of COTS executable/software and apps as applied to flight and/or space applications, the ability to easily customize the viewer (e.g., visual formats, precision data viewing), ease of interface to hand held device/computer, and minimal expenditure for development and implementation.

Additionally, KSC develops GSE for use during processing, launch preparation, and launch activities.  All GSE used at KSC during the processing flow is tracked and identified during ground operations planning activities.  The Ground Operations Planning Database (GOPDb) provides the application to coordinate the various aspects of the ground planning phase.  \r\n\r\nAdditional rigor and visibility into the GSE component of ground operations planning is critical to a seamless and cost effective planning and design phase.  An integrated GSE tracking solution must be developed to provide visibility, accountability, and configuration control of GSE data to all stakeholders while ensuring that the source data remains appropriately controlled and protected.  \r\n\r\nThis  integrated GSE tracking and management tool  the Ground Hardware Management Tool (GHMT)  Application - for tracking and managing GSE data used in support of KSC\\GSDO operations planning and launch campaigns.  \r\n\r\nThe GHMT will be fully integrated with the GOPDb to provide a complete ground operations planning solution.",

The incident sound can be generated by the FSC using a collection of simple point multipoles (monopoles and dipoles), or it can be provided by the user from other prediction codes. Predictions for high-frequency/large scale-combinations yield linear systems with millions of unknowns and memory requirements beyond the capabilities of most advanced computer systems to date. The computational engine of the FSC has been totally redesigned to alleviate the frequency limitations of the code by employing numerical algorithms that drastically reduce computer resource utilization and take advantage of multiprocessor platforms.",

The SCOREboards are generated by a computer program that extracts data from the main repository, sorts the data based on a range of categories corresponding to the data structure, then plots the data according to specified user inputs. The ability to sort and plot varying data categories provides the flexibility to present specific SCOREboard capability roadmaps based on customer requests. ",

      "description": "The Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation code (ParaGrandMC) is a highly parallelized code in FORTRAN for simulating the thermodynamic evolution of metal alloy systems at atomic level, and predicting their thermodynamic state, phase diagram, chemical composition and mechanical properties. The approach taken is based on evolving an initially given atomic system (defined through a list of atomic coordinates of all participating atoms) using Monte Carlo algorithm. The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process, internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. \r\n\r\nThe code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can also be used for any other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas interfaces.

Input for CompDam includes ply-level material properties, and interface properties obtained from standard material characterization tests.

Forest preservation initiatives, carbon measurement initiatives, water management and agricultural monitoring are just few examples of causes that can benefit greatly from remote sensing data.  Currently, however, many developing nations lack the in-country expertise and computational infrastructure to utilize remote sensing data.\r\n\r\nThe CEOS Data Cube Platform provides a flexible model to address these needs.  The CEOS Data Cube Platform is a data processing platform for Earth science data, with a focus on remote-sensing data.  The platform provides a data ingestion framework that includes support for automated ingestion of a wide variety of remote sensing data products.  The data products are ingested into an N-dimensional data array that abstracts away management of distinct acquisitions.   The platform has a tiered API for data processing and a data/application platform layer for higher-level access.",

The DSMC method is widely used for the modeling of gas flows through the computation of the motion and collisions of representative molecules.  Computation at the molecular level is necessary for studies in rarefied gas dynamics (RGD) because the transport terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are not valid in this flow regime.  The essential characteristic of a \"rarefied\" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible.\r\n\r\nThe software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature.  The gas model includes internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase chemical reactions, and surface reactions.  MAP uses an N-Level embedded Cartesian grid system and a separate surface geometry that is embedded within the grid that is made up of unstructured triangular elements.",

Most of the coefficients are linearized, and based on the set of parameters provided in Roskam, Airplane Flight Dynamics (Reference 1) when available.  The intent was that any other transport aircraft could be modeled at the same level by providing the equivalent set of data.  (Appendix C describes levels of simulation modeling.)

The intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to safety critical systems in air traffic management. One application is weather avoidance. A weather cell can be approximated by a polygon, and PolyCARP provides algorithms to detect whether a trajectory will intersect such a polygon in the near future and will provide maneuver guidance to avoid the polygon. If the trajectory is inside the polygon at the current time, PolyCARP provides algorithms for maneuver guidance to exit the polygon. Another application is ensuring that an aircraft stays inside a predetermined safety region, also known as assured containment, and PolyCARP provides algorithms that ensure that a point is inside or outside a particular polygonal region. Another application is obstacle avoidance by an aircraft. There are several functionalities provided by PolyCARP. There are algorithms to insure that a point is contained in or excluded from a polygon. There are also collision detection algorithms that determine if a moving point intersects a polygon, including the case where the polygon is moving or even warping over time, as well as where the polygon and the point are following piecewise linear trajectories. There are algorithms that resolve potential collisions between and point and a polygon by providing collision-free trajectories, and there are algorithms that compute new trajectories to regain separation from a polygon.",

To facilitate conceptual interplanetary mission sizing activities, it is essential to obtain sufficiently accurate trajectories in a fast and repeatable manner. To this end, the VISITOR software tool was developed. This tool modularly augments a patched conic, multiple gravity-assist with one deep space manuever (MGA-1DSM) trajectory model with a mass model, launch window analysis, and the capability to simulate realistic arrival and departure operations. The tool was validated against seven flown missions: the average total mission delta-V offset from the nominal trajectory was 9.1%, and was reduced to 7.3% when using the genetic algorithm at the cost of an increase in computation time by a factor 5.7. VISITOR is well-suited for the conceptual design of interplanetary trajectories and facilitates future improvements due to its modular structure.",

DAIDALUS consists of algorithms for determining the current well-clear status between two aircraft and for predicting a well-clear violation within a lookahead time, assuming non-maneuvering trajectories. In the case of a predicted well-clear violation, DAIDALUS also provides an algorithm that computes the time interval of well-clear violation. Furthermore, DAIDALUS implements algorithms for computing prevention bands, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model. Prevention bands are ranges of track, ground speed, and vertical speed maneuvers that are predicted to be in well-clear violation within a given lookahead time.\r\n",

Any propellant system can be modeled. Outputs of the code include files that contain the thruster/spike contour and a summary output file for each thruster/spike design point, as well as vacuum and delivered performance data for the thruster and the entire thruster/spike module. One-dimensional performance data are also included for both the thruster and aerospike so that efficiencies and comparisons may be made.",

The tool creates individual processed data files (one file per transducer per test run), converting raw voltage to meaningful measurements such as pressure or temperature. \r\nEngineering Units are generated by the Low Speed Data Processing System (LSDPS) in addition to performing calculated values or parameters at different levels in order to provide the customer with the final data product. LSDPS utilizes the NIST REFPROPS program to calculate thermo-physical properties over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Use of these programs requires proficiency in Linux, C and PV-Wave (separate license required) programming languages and bash scripts. A GCC compiler is invoked with the make file in each C code program directory.

      "description": "The Application Research Toolbox (ART) is a collection of computer programs that implement algorithms and parametric mathematical models for simulating remote sensing systems, developed in MATLAB. The ART is intended to be especially useful for performing design-tradeoff studies and statistical analyses to support the rational development of design requirements for multispectral imaging systems. Among other things, the ART affords a capability to synthesize coarser-spatial-resolution image-data sets from finer-spatial-resolution data sets and multispectral-image-data products from hyperspectral-image-data products. The ART also provides for synthesis of image-degradation effects, including point-spread functions, misregistration of spectral images, and noise. The ART can utilize real or synthetic data sets, along with sensor specifications, to create simulated data sets. In one example of a typical application, simulated data pertaining to an existing multispectral sensor system are used to verify the data collected by the system in operation. In the case of a proposed sensor system, the simulated data can be used to conduct trade studies and statistical analyses to ensure that the sensor system will satisfy the requirements of potential scientific, academic, and commercial user communities.  ART is designed to run on a standard Windows NT/2000 workstation and MATLAB version 6.5.  A Programmers Reference is included to provide additional detail on setting up the operational environment.",

      "description": "A software suite, developed to support NASAs in-flight characterization of commercial remote sensing systems, efficiently automates reproducible processing of ground truth data.  It is unique in that it takes input from a number of disparate data sources, condenses and rapidly processes it, to a form useable by the characterization process. It has been largely automated to reduce operator error as much as possible\r\nWritten and developed in the MATLAB programming environment, the characterization suite consists of radiometric, geometric and spatial scripts that require knowledge of MODTRAN and expertise to run. Each type of characterization relies on knowledge of ground characteristics, or ground truth, some of which must be acquired at the time of sensor overpass.  Examples of ground truth data include target reflectance, incident solar irradiance, atmospheric pressure and water vapor, aerosol content, and target location. All of these data sets must be processed in order to be used for in-flight characterization.\r\nPreviously used to perform radiometric, geometric, and spatial characterization on the IKONOS, QuickBird, OrbView-3, and AWiFS satellite sensors.\r\n",

      "description": "An automated Spatial Resolution Verification Tool (SRVT) was developed to rapidly determine the spatial resolution characteristics of remotely sensed aerial and satellite imagery. Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).\r\n\r\nDeveloped using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired data set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a data set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.\r\nThe SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.",
