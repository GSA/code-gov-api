The tool offers a reliable method for calculating theoretical fatigue crack growths that could lead to catastrophic structural component failures. The program builds upon and integrates Armstrong's proven half-cycle and closed-form aging theories and is especially accurate because it considers every half-cycle of loading spectra for specific structural components. The program works by reading test data files and determining maximum and minimum loads of each half-cycle of random loading spectra in order to calculate theoretical crack growth. The innovation is an improvement on traditional prediction software (and in particular on visual inspections) because it considers mini-amplitude stress loading and half-cycles based on the duty cycle of a particular component or structure.",

Optimization can then take place within each discipline module, or in a loop between the central executive module and the discipline modules, or both. This version uses  a public-domain optimization code, Automated Design Synthesis (ADS) version 1.10, instead of using the DOT code.  We tested this updated version using couple of sample test problems. The public domain code, ADS version 1.10, was developed by Vanderplaats using NASAs budget around 1984.",

      "description": "This is an easy-to-use MATLAB based finite element modeling and simulation tool for aeroservoelastic analysis of rectangular wings with trailing-edge control surfaces. It includes a tutorial on structural finite element modeling (FEM_Tutorial.m) using elements such as 12 DOF plates and 6 DOF beams. The aero tutorial (DLM_VLM_Tutorial.m) shows how to code doublet lattice and vortex lattice, with symmetry capability. Together the finite element and aero tutorials can be used to compare to experimental studies such as ground vibration testing, cantilever beam analysis, as well as wind tunnel testing. The primary code, EZASE.m, links structures and aero together in a commented way to produce a wing in flutter which can be controlled. The wing may include control surfaces or they can be excluded. A state space model with control surface inputs and accelerometer outputs can be produced. This model is used to design a PID control system and is tested using margin studies and pole plots. Other visualization methods such as V-g plots determined using the K-method are also included. The code is commented for Graduate and Undergraduate students of aeroservoelasticity who want to know the basic concepts of medium fidelity aeroservoelastic modeling. Not all methods are coded to industry standards. But students of the field including practicing engineers may find it useful for basic understanding; theoretical manuals for industry level codes tend to leave out many of the coding details. All of the details of the code are open sourced here and most of it is referenced at the top of the file to its source paper or book section. Two AIAA publications with one focusing on V&V with experimental wind tunnel test and ground vibration test data are also included.",

      "description": "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited.\r\n\r\nmagnetic bearings are an enabling technology for rotating devices with extremely high rotational speeds, such as flywheel energy storage systems being proposed for the International Space Station.  In addition these bearings have great potential for conventional gas turbine engines especially because the control algorithms can compensate for an event such as loss of a blade that causes rotor imbalance.",

The Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool processes a diagnostic model developed from a commercial software package called TEAMS Designer using a defined set of modeling conventiuons and practices. ETA Tool can provide an assessment of the modeled system based on diagnostic metrics of detectability and failure isolation. The program can provide assessment of a system's detection coverage, test utilization, failure isolation at the root cause or at the component levels, generate a FMEA Report, perform sensor sensitivity studies and provide a trace-mapping of failure modes to higher level system effects. ETA Tool generates reports from each selected analysis option in both an HTML and XML format to enable user access in either standard web browsers or loadable into an Microsoft Excel workbook for review/editing.",

      "description": "FATMaCC (Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Control Code), is a versatile control code that possesses many desirable features that were not available in previous in-house controllers.  The ultimate goal in designing this code was to achieve full rotor levitation and control at a loop time of 50 s.  Using a 1-GHz processor the code will control a five-axis system in either a decentralized or a more elegant centralized (model control) mode at loop time of 56  s.  In addition, it will levitate and control (with only minor modification to the input-output wiring) a two-axis and / or a four-axis system.  Stable rotor levitation and control of any of the system mentioned above are accomplished through appropriate key presses to modify parameters, such as stiffness, damping, and bias.  A signal generation block provides 11 excitation signals.  An excitation signal is then superimposed on the radial bearing x- and y- control signals, thus producing a resultant force vector.  By modulating the signals on the bearing x0 and y- axes with a cosine and sine function, respectively, a radial excitation force vector is made to rotate 360 about the bearing geometric center.  The rotation of the force vector is achieved manually by using key press or automatically by engaging the \" one-per-revolution\" feature.  Rotor rigid body modes can be excited by using the excitation module.  Depending on the polarities of the excitation signal in each radial bearing, the bounce or tilt mode will be excited",

OpenMDAO is the open source framework developed by NASA that will be accessible via an open source website to reach the entire broad based MDAO community to facilitate advancing the science of MDAO.  MDAO covers a vast set of capabilities, including a flexible framework and state of the art discipline codes.  This innovation relates specifically to the framework.  OpenMDAO provides the core software infrastructure to integrate multidisciplinary variable fidelity tools and enable design, analysis, and optimization of complex systems.  Currently, the OpenMDAO version 0.1 functionalities include component linking, data passing, driver interface, and lazy evaluation.  This initial basic capability of the framework is sufficient for users to run and optimize their analysis after they integrate their specific component codes.  As OpenMDAO evolves, the following capabilities will be included in the framework:  interprocess communications, error handling, user interfaces, geometry application program interfaces (APIs), plug-in interfaces, utilities to wrap tools, versioning, and parallel processing support.  To be clear, the framework will enable the integration of, but will not include: optimizers, solvers, visualization tools, custom data types, script components, and discipline codes.  AEROSPACE:  To meet the present and future economic and environmental challenges facing air transportation, aviation design must expand its focus from today's conventional \"wing-body-tail\" aircraft to more advanced vehicles.   The ability to design revolutionary aircraft to improve mobility and air transport efficiency is of paramount importance to the national economy, along with reducing our environmental impact and supporting national defense.   Technologies such as the one disclosed here incorporate progressively more sophisticated computational models and methods, enabling future aircraft designs today.",

The resulting optical link budget essentially accounts for the communication power flow through the entire optical communications channel from the transmitter to the receiver and yields design specifications for the optical system necessary to assure reliable data transmission with desired operational metrics such as data rate, link margin, etc. The link assessment tool takes into account all the sources of deleterious noise that enters into the communications process such as electronically generated noise in the optical detector and stray optical irradiance from external sources. The link budget has the capability of being interfaced with the orbital element calculations of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to allow the dynamic description and evolution of optical link operation from any space-borne satellite within the solar system to and from the earth. The current version implements PPM and DPSK modulation types that can use PIN, APD, or nanowire optical detectors in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. Coded and un-coded link power margins are provided.  This version of the tool also has the ability 1) to solve for prevailing potential data rates given a desired optical power link margin and 2) treat the spatial separations of optical link transmitter and receiver within thefirst Fresnel zone.",

LERCHP can be used as a design tool on a personal computer or, with a suitable calling routine, as a subroutine for a mainframe radiator code.  For accurate heat pipe modeling, a variety of wick structures are available to the user, including a user wick input option.  Several working fluids can be chosen as well, including potassium, sodium, and lithium, for which the monomer-dimer equilibrium is considered.  A vapor flow algorithm is incorporated that treats compressibility and axially varying heat input.  LERCHP also facilitates the determination of heat pipe operating temperatures and heat pipe limits that may be encountered at the specified heat input and environment temperature.\r\n\r\n",

The simulation operates in the detonation frame of reference and utilizes a relatively coarse grid such that only the essential primary flow field structure is captured. This construction and other simplifications yield rapidly converging, steady solutions that can be obtained on a modern single processor computer.  Viscous effects, and heat transfer effects are modeled using source terms.  The effects of potential inlet flow reversals are modeled using boundary conditions.  Output from the simulation compares favorably to measured data from numerous experimental RDE rigs.  The speed and fidelity of the code render it useful as a performance optimization tool as well as a diagnostic tool to supplement the current limitations of experimental measurement techniques in the hostile engine environment.",

It is composed of several parts:\r\n\r\nThe Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Testing (ASIST) is the user-interface, providing user with the ability to view and analyze telemetry, send commands, and automate tests. The Front End Data System reads telemetry from spacecrafts, distributing requested data packets to subscribing clients; additionally, it controls the forward (command) link to the spacecraft, formatting command packets so that the spacecraft can read them and verifying that commands are transferred correctly. The Digital History Data Store (DHDS) archives the raw telemetry received from the spacecraft and distributes historical telemetry data to clients.\r\n\r\nThis system can be configured in a number of ways. For small labs, a single ASIST workstation may be used, while in I&T or mission operations, the configuration may include up to 31 ASIST workstations. All configurations provide the user with the same standard interface to their flight hardware.",

      "description": "The purpose of GRASP is to provide a generic operating-system-independent framework for creating multi-process real-time applications. In the modular GRASP architecture, all operating system and hardware interfaces are isolated within GRASP libraries. The application developer uses GRASP interface libraries and device drivers to interact with external hardware. Should a new hardware item require a driver, that development would be part of GRASP and would be added to the GRASP interface libraries and become available for future projects. GRASP application software is developed by using the GRASP template, which offers access to the services GRASP provides. The templated generic code handles process initialization, thread creation, inter-process messaging, process health monitoring, data logging, data distribution, etc., with hooks that provide for subsystem tailoring. Using GRASP allows application developers to concentrate on mission specifics, reducing development time, cost, and risk.",

Each investigation team generally tackles these challenges independently and reach various plateaus of performance that are well below those that are theoretically and demonstrably achievable. At the same time, pseudospectral algorithms have many unique characteristics that limit the applicability/efficacy of many software frameworks used by the high performance computing community. Such characteristics include \"transposes\" - large redistributions of data across an entire computing platform, nontrivial computational domains (e.g. spherical harmonic modes), little-or-no nearest-neighbor communication, and high computational intensity (DGEMM, FFT, etc). The goals of SpF (Spectral Framework) are to (1) reduce complexity and duplication of effort across multiple investigation teams, (2) achieve near optimal scalability on existing computing architectures (10\"4-10\"5 cores), (3) provide automation for domain decomposition and load balancing that circumvent hardwired constraints in existing applications, (4) provide automated and optimized global data \"transpososes\" that dominate compute time for large problems, (5) provide access to optimized numerical libraries including libraries implemented on hardware accelerators, and (6) provide a flexible/optimized input/output layer.",

      "description": "The Bundle Protocol (BP) is an international standard produced by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Standards (CCSDS).  It is a key piece of the planned Interplanetary Internet.  The basic idea is that BP is given bundles to deliver, and it delivers them to their specified destination, using the appropriate route.  For example, the route might be from a Mars Rover to a Mars Orbiter to a Ground Station on Earth to a Mission Control Center.  For each hop along the way, BP asks for assistance from the appropriate lower-level protocol.  For example, to move bundles from a Ground Station to a Mission Control Center, it might use the Transmission Control Protocol (tcp).  Generally, the lower-level protocol is responsible for providing reliable delivery across one hop, while BP manages the bigger picture (i.e. getting bundles across all the required hops).\r\n\r\nThe Bundle Protocol Software Library implements the Bundle Protocol, using a software architecture that is simple and fast enough to be attractive to Goddard mission designers.   It has been developed for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission and the Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) group.  It is useful for any organization (commercial or otherwise) that is interested in being part of the Interplanetary Internet.",

      "description": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) spacecraft (S/C) flight software (FSW) controls and coordinates all aspects of the spacecraft's operation in nominal and anomolous conditions.  It distributes commands to, and collects data from, all spacecraft subsystems and  the science instruments.  The FSW controls high gain antenna pointing to TDRSS satellites and manages communications with the ground controllers in real time to receive commands (during SSA contacts) and send housekeeping telemetry data during SSA and MA contacts.  It sends science data using the Class-2 CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).  The GPM FSW monitors the health of  most orbiter subsystems and takes corrective actions when necessary.  \r\nThe GPM FSW controls the pointing of the spacecraft/instruments to the earth's surface, the orientation of the solar arrays to collect power,  and the pointing of the high gain antenna to communicate with TDRSS.   The GPM FSW uses the propulsion system to perform orbit station keeping and re-entry upon mission completion.  The GPM FSW also implements a safehold controller and can perform \"yaw maneuvers\" to re-orient the spacecraft velocity vector by 180 degrees.\r\nThe GPM FSW uses Goddard's Operating System Abstration Layer (OSAL) and the Core Flight Executive (cFE) software. Ten Core Flight System (CFS) applications were co-developed by GPM and Code 582 and are now available in the Code 582 library for future mission use.\r\n",

The map also provides the ability to correct or adjust the known position of the rover through the technique of overlaying images acquired from the rover on top of the HiRISE image.

This effort will culminate with the system-level radiation test of complete ISAAC technology that matures it to TRL 6. Success of this effort will result in a flight-ready product in the 2010-time-frame for infusion into SMAP/HYDROS, one of Decadal flight missions.",

It provides basic low-level filtering, texture analysis, and subwindow descriptors for applications dealing with image interpretation and object recognition. The library is designed with spaceflight applications in mind; specifically, it addresses the following requirements: - Ease of integration (minimal external dependencies). - Fast real-time operation, using integer arithmetic when possible - Written entirely in C - \"Mostly static\" memory allocation - 8-bit image data. This implementation is well-suited for the computational constraints of spaceflight.",

The found relationship is applied to non-calibration frames which are the measurements of an object of interest such as asteroids and other planetary objects that MIRO encounters during its operation. This software characterizes the gain fluctuations statistically and determines which method to estimate gain between calibration frames. ",

      "description": "It has long been the practice to fix double differenced integer phase ambiguities when processing GPS data from multiple receivers. When the double differenced combination of phase biases can be fixed reliably a significant improvement in solution accuracy is obtained. The procedure is complicated and compute intensive, due to the need for multiple receivers to form the double difference. The constraint on the integers is added to the solution as a measurement with infinite precision. This software introduces a new method. First the process, uses a large global set of GPS receivers (40-80 receivers) to solve for the GPS satellite orbits and clocks ( along with many other parameters ). ",

This software coded in MATLAB, a widely used analysis software package, that takes as input any image of an object or phenomenon of scientific interest, along with two reference images generated by the same digital imaging hardware, applies corrections for the three most prominent sources of image degradation, and outputs a corrected image of the object or phenomenon.

The tool serves as a single application that will maintain guest and mission information, run standard reports, email guests, produce mailing labels, and export data. Via the Internet, invited guests can access EGO Web pages from all over the world to register their attendance intentions, access relevant mission data, and update their contact information. After guest registration, administrative support personnel have used EGO to maintain guest-seating assignments, send email communications, maintain attendance to special receptions, and gather security information for foreign guests. EGO replaces a very paper-intensive process, saves a significant amount in postage costs, and reduces error-prone data entry. The tool has been built with flexibility and customization in mind. Its initial scope was broadened to also serve as the login for people invited to view an International Space Station Friends and Family Web site created by Wyle Life Sciences. The Constellation program also used EGO to invite guests to attend the Pad Abort (PA-1) test flight in 2010.",

Text fields in problem report data records (e.g., discrepancy reports, problem reports, corrective-action reports, and software change reports) might contain information that is critical to finding trends and groupings of recurring problems. STAT overcomes problems with scoping by linking up meaningful phrases that could be separated by text (e.g., \"not aligned\" versus \"not completely aligned\"). STAT's use of hierarchical ontologies overcomes the limitations of data codes, which are flat, closed, and have small sets of values that are often difficult to interpret. The ontology organizes aerospace terminology in hierarchies of types of problems, properties, objects, and functions. The tool identifies and tags types of problems and equipment mentioned in text fields, thereby providing new data files for record keeping. These new data files support text mining and clustering, report generation, browsing, and search at various levels of abstraction.",

Martin Marietta Corp. developed the program, called UD233A, for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. DSS was used to study performance of parachute descent of flight test vehicle versions of the NASA Orion space craft. DSS incorporates 6 degrees of translational and rotational motion for both the vehicle and attached parachute, It models the deployment and inflation of the parachute system. DSS has separate aerodynamic and mass properties for both the vehicle and parachute.\r\nDSS is an in-house analysis tool. As such there is little documentation on the modifications made to UD233A to create DSS.\r\n",

This will be accomplished by:\r\nA graphical component-connection model is created by arranging and connecting components selected from the Master Equipment list.\r\n\r\nFor each component, a pick-list user interface asks a few questions to narrow down potential failure modes.  This uses a failure mode library in MS Excel based on standard failure modes and associated component functions and features.\r\n\r\nPick-lists for types failure mode causes and immediate effects help the analyst complete initial draft FMEA worksheets, which link to the components in the model.\r\n\r\nThe graphical model, which is marked with redundant components and paths, shows upstream/downstream dependencies, to help the analyst add further effects and criticality to the FMEA worksheets.\r\n\r\nThis tool is innovative because it saves analysis time and provides a standardized and systematic approach in failure analysis, thereby enabling risk mitigation early in system design.  There are also potential benefits of tool use during the operations phase to identify the cause(s) of a fault or failure.   \r\n",

      "description": "The GFE Lo-Fi Chutes Model provides basic modeling capability of a sequential series of parachute activities.  Actions include deploying the parachute, changing the reefing on the parachute, and cutting away the parachute.  Multiple chutes can be deployed at any given time, but all chutes in that case are assumed to behave as individually isolated chutes; there is no modeling of any interactions between deployed chutes.  Drag characteristics of a deployed chute are based on a coefficient of drag, the face-area of the chute, and the local dynamic pressure only.  The orientation of the chute is approximately modeled for purposes of obtaining torques on the vehicle, but the dynamic state of the chute as a separate entity is not integrated, the treatment is simply an approximation. \r\n\r\nPlans for every post-shuttle manned vehicle which will reenter Earth's atmosphere, or for that matter, the Martian atmosphere, include a descent phase controlled by some sort of parachute system.  Having a NASA-certified parachute model which can be plugged into various flight simulators is a huge advantage.  Building a special purpose parachute simulator for a specific simulation is at least a million dollar job.  Lockheed Martin had to do exactly that in order to support Pad Abort I, and GFEChutes Lo-Fi was tested against the Lockheed prototype.  \r\n\r\nHaving a verified, Class C parachute model, packaged in a reusable (plug-and-play) form, is smart technically and an outstanding strategic move as we enter the world of commercial manned space flight.

      "description": "The code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks) has been developed over the last years at the NASA Johnson Space Center to simulate the effects of ionizing radiations at the microscopic scale and to understand the effects of space radiation at the biological level. The fundamental part of this code is the stochastic simulation of radiation track structure of heavy ions, an important component of space radiations. The code can calculate many relevant quantities such as the radial dose, voxel dose, and may also be used to calculate the dose in spherical and cylindrical targets of various sizes. Recently, we have incorporated DNA structure and damage simulations at the molecular scale in RITRACKS. The direct effect of radiations is simulated by introducing a slight modification of the existing particle transport algorithms, using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model of ionization cross sections for each molecular orbitals of DNA. The simulation of radiation chemistry is done by a step-by-step diffusion-reaction program based on the Greens functions of the diffusion equation. This approach is also used to simulate the indirect effect of ionizing radiation on DNA. The software can be installed independently on PC and tablets using the Windows operating system and does not require any coding from the user. It includes a Graphic User Interface (GUI) and a 3D OpenGL visualization interface. The calculations are executed simultaneously (in parallel) on multiple CPUs. ",

The motivation for its development is a consequence of the Columbia accident, where foam used to insulate the external tank dislodged during ascent and struck the wing leading edge of the Orbiter.

While these two document types offer different approaches for hazard identification and classification, they both offer controls for mitigating hazards. HMS provides a framework within which HA and JHA documents are created, reviewed, and approved. Once approved, the hazardous conditions identified within a document are considered active. More important, the controls associated with the hazards are then also considered active. HMS includes the mechanisms required to evaluate hazards using standard Risk Assessment Code (RAC) scoring.",

      "description": "ALSSAT has been developed for use in the sizing and analysis of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) for spacecraft and habitats. The purpose of this tool is to perform life support system trade studies and analysis. ALSSAT aids in the creation of conceptual designs for advanced systems using physiochemical and biological processes in either open-loop systems or closed-loop systems that recycle air and water as well as process human waste products. The regenerative life support processes can be used as a means to decrease the amount of consumable re-supply required for a range of missions including in-space transit vehicles or habitats, and surface habitats on the moon or Mars. Since not all missions are long enough to payback the mass of the recycling hardware, or may not need all possible resources that could be recycled, determining the best suite of technologies to provide the right amount of resource recovery for each mission is very difficult.  Because so many technological combinations are possible, the development of an Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) was created as a means to investigate these combinations. This tool assists in the determination of the most mass effective and reliable combination of methods available for a steady-state operating condition. ALSSAT has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program and has been programmed to perform multiple-case mission scenarios through Visual Basic (VB) interface forms for data input and computational analysis of ALS subsystems. Based on the preliminary design considerations, the Advanced Life Support system mass, power, and volume are computed for various mission specifications. The results can be used as a guide to select the best system architecture.",

Data and analyses of accelerations is important for phemomena and systems that are sensitive to gravity, such as multiphase fluid flow (e.g., gas and liquid concurrent flows).  These data measurements are required for parabolic, suborbital and/or space testing and operations to evaluate research and hardware under the dynamic and different test/operational environment in zero- and/or low-gravity. The current data viewer configuration was developed using the COTS Labview Runtime Engine executable available for free download from the National Instruments website (http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2012/3433/en/; http://ftp.ni.com/support/softlib/labview/labview_runtime/2012/Windows/LVRTE2012f3std.exe).  In addition, the viewer uses COTS apps for retrieval/transfer of data from an Apple iTouch into the customizable Labview program . Key features are the use of COTS executable/software and apps as applied to flight and/or space applications, the ability to easily customize the viewer (e.g., visual formats, precision data viewing), ease of interface to hand held device/computer, and minimal expenditure for development and implementation.

      "description": "The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) is a computer program designed to predict the scattered acoustic field that results from the interaction between a known incident sound and arbitrary three-dimensional surfaces immersed in a potential background flow. The technology is based on the equations of time-harmonic, linearized acoustics and employs equivalent sources for solving an exterior Helmholtz equation boundary value problem (BVP). The incident sound can be generated by the FSC using a collection of simple point multipoles (monopoles and dipoles), or it can be provided by the user from other prediction codes. Predictions for high-frequency/large scale-combinations yield linear systems with millions of unknowns and memory requirements beyond the capabilities of most advanced computer systems to date. The computational engine of the FSC has been totally redesigned to alleviate the frequency limitations of the code by employing numerical algorithms that drastically reduce computer resource utilization and take advantage of multiprocessor platforms.",

The SCOREboards present an overview of multiple data points (the performance gaps and their durations, the corresponding gap closing tasks, task testing locations, mission need, and mission criticality) that when viewed together provide a roadmap of system maturation critical for the Journey to Mars. The SCOREboards are generated by a computer program that extracts data from the main repository, sorts the data based on a range of categories corresponding to the data structure, then plots the data according to specified user inputs. The ability to sort and plot varying data categories provides the flexibility to present specific SCOREboard capability roadmaps based on customer requests. ",

      "description": "The Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation code (ParaGrandMC) is a highly parallelized code in FORTRAN for simulating the thermodynamic evolution of metal alloy systems at atomic level, and predicting their thermodynamic state, phase diagram, chemical composition and mechanical properties. The approach taken is based on evolving an initially given atomic system (defined through a list of atomic coordinates of all participating atoms) using Monte Carlo algorithm. The algorithm is based on repeated random sampling of the configuration space of the system using the classical Boltzmann probability distribution. In the process, internal variables of the system, such as system energy, internal pressure, system size (strain), and others, are reported periodically. Atomic configurations, in terms of coordinates of all atoms, are stored periodically for a post-processing analysis, such as phase identification, lattice parameter estimates, free energy integration, etc. The algorithm uses MPI (message passing interface) to work on multi-core CPU platforms allowing simulations of multimilion atom systems. \r\n\r\nThe code is designed to help exploring the phase diagram of multi-component alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can also be used for any other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas interfaces.

Hence, modeling of damage progression is undertaken at the meso-scale, where each ply of a laminate is represented as a homogenous orthotropic continuum. All of the composite damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, fiber breaking and kinking, and delamination) and their interactions are represented. The CompDam software is implemented as user written subroutines for use with the Abaqus commercial finite element code.  Input for CompDam includes ply-level material properties, and interface properties obtained from standard material characterization tests.

The technique transforms one or more objective functions into reduced objective functions analogous to goal constraints used in the goal programming method. The reduced objective\r\nfunctions are appended to the set of constraints and an envelope of the entire function set is computed using the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function.  This envelope function is then searched for an unconstrained minimum. The technique may be categorized as a SUMT algorithm.  Version 3.1 is written in the FORTRAN 90/95 standard and improves upon the robustness of the code by preventing potential memory allocation errors.",

The implementation is given the acronym RANSTEP for Reduced order Analysis using a Nonlinear STiffness Evaluation Procedure.  The nonlinear stiffness evaluation procedure allows computation of otherwise inaccessible modal nonlinear stiffness terms from commercial finite element programs.  Some operations are performed outside the commercial codes and utilize in-house developed FORTRAN codes.  Additionally Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP) alters and PYTHON scripts are used to facilitate implementations written about MSC.NASTRAN and ABAQUS, respectively.  Two solutions procedures of different fidelity and computational cost are offered in each implementation.  They are equivalent linearization and time numerical simulation. Aerospace uses include aircraft and spacecraft structural analysis.",

The DSMC method is widely used for the modeling of gas flows through the computation of the motion and collisions of representative molecules.  Computation at the molecular level is necessary for studies in rarefied gas dynamics (RGD) because the transport terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are not valid in this flow regime.  The essential characteristic of a \"rarefied\" flow is that the molecular mean free path is not negligible.\r\n\r\nThe software has been designed to be as automated as possible to achieve a quality solution with minimal user input and control by performing dynamic adaptations of the grid, local time step, and surface temperature.  The gas model includes internal degrees of freedom (rotational, vibrational, and electronic), gas phase chemical reactions, and surface reactions.  MAP uses an N-Level embedded Cartesian grid system and a separate surface geometry that is embedded within the grid that is made up of unstructured triangular elements.",

Present day solvers are limited by computational speed and do not have all the capabilities such as interior volume grid clustering control, viscous grid clustering at the wall of a configuration, truncation error limiters, block-to-block C-I continuity, convergence optimization, and MPI parallel computing residing in one code. A new volume grid generator, 3DGRAPE/AL (Three-Dimensional Grids about Anything by Poisson Equations with Ames and Langley upgrades), which is based on the original 3DGRAPE and 3DMAGGS codes, has evolved to meet these needs. The distribution comes with the source code, installation instructions, sample problems, and pre- and post-processors for evaluating grid smoothing convergence and interfacing to GRIDGEN/POINTWISE.",

The result produces a possible approach to completing all mission requirements and is intended for basic feasibility analysis.  To build a new timeline, the user is prompted to enter the name of each building block and the number of times it is to be used.  The program builds an EVA timeline to complete science and exploration objectives while complying with current human spaceflight limits on the number of hours of EVA allowed per day and week.  At completion, the program displays the timeline, number of days to complete all requirements, number of rest days, and number of sites visited.  The database keeps a record of activities and building blocks used in all surface missions and is easily searchable by the user or the program.",

      "description": "PolyCARP is a package of algorithms, including both their formal models and software implementations, for computing containment, collision, resolution, and recovery information for polygons. The intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to safety critical systems in air traffic management. One application is weather avoidance. A weather cell can be approximated by a polygon, and PolyCARP provides algorithms to detect whether a trajectory will intersect such a polygon in the near future and will provide maneuver guidance to avoid the polygon. If the trajectory is inside the polygon at the current time, PolyCARP provides algorithms for maneuver guidance to exit the polygon. Another application is ensuring that an aircraft stays inside a predetermined safety region, also known as assured containment, and PolyCARP provides algorithms that ensure that a point is inside or outside a particular polygonal region. Another application is obstacle avoidance by an aircraft. There are several functionalities provided by PolyCARP. There are algorithms to insure that a point is contained in or excluded from a polygon. There are also collision detection algorithms that determine if a moving point intersects a polygon, including the case where the polygon is moving or even warping over time, as well as where the polygon and the point are following piecewise linear trajectories. There are algorithms that resolve potential collisions between and point and a polygon by providing collision-free trajectories, and there are algorithms that compute new trajectories to regain separation from a polygon.",

To facilitate conceptual interplanetary mission sizing activities, it is essential to obtain sufficiently accurate trajectories in a fast and repeatable manner. To this end, the VISITOR software tool was developed. This tool modularly augments a patched conic, multiple gravity-assist with one deep space manuever (MGA-1DSM) trajectory model with a mass model, launch window analysis, and the capability to simulate realistic arrival and departure operations. The tool was validated against seven flown missions: the average total mission delta-V offset from the nominal trajectory was 9.1%, and was reduced to 7.3% when using the genetic algorithm at the cost of an increase in computation time by a factor 5.7. VISITOR is well-suited for the conceptual design of interplanetary trajectories and facilitates future improvements due to its modular structure.",

Furthermore, DAIDALUS implements algorithms for computing prevention bands, assuming a simple kinematic trajectory model.

MMM-Py can read MRMS mosaics from either their unique binary format or their converted NetCDF format; it can also read and properly interpret the current mosaic design (4 regional tiles) as well as mosaics produced prior to late July 2013 (8 tiles). The technology can easily stitch multiple tiles together to provide a larger regional or national picture of precipitating weather systems. Composites, horizontal/vertical cross-sections, and combinations thereof are easily displayed using as little as one line of code.",

The ART is intended to be especially useful for performing design-tradeoff studies and statistical analyses to support the rational development of design requirements for multispectral imaging systems. Among other things, the ART affords a capability to synthesize coarser-spatial-resolution image-data sets from finer-spatial-resolution data sets and multispectral-image-data products from hyperspectral-image-data products. The ART also provides for synthesis of image-degradation effects, including point-spread functions, misregistration of spectral images, and noise. The ART can utilize real or synthetic data sets, along with sensor specifications, to create simulated data sets. In one example of a typical application, simulated data pertaining to an existing multispectral sensor system are used to verify the data collected by the system in operation. In the case of a proposed sensor system, the simulated data can be used to conduct trade studies and statistical analyses to ensure that the sensor system will satisfy the requirements of potential scientific, academic, and commercial user communities.  ART is designed to run on a standard Windows NT/2000 workstation and MATLAB version 6.5.  A Programmers Reference is included to provide additional detail on setting up the operational environment.",

      "description": "An automated Spatial Resolution Verification Tool (SRVT) was developed to rapidly determine the spatial resolution characteristics of remotely sensed aerial and satellite imagery. Most current methods for assessing spatial resolution characteristics of imagery rely on pre-deployed engineered targets and are performed only at selected times within pre-selected scenes. The SRVT addresses these insufficiencies by finding uniform, high-contrast edges from urban scenes and then using these edges to determine standard estimators of spatial resolution, such as the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the relative edge response (RER).\r\n\r\nDeveloped using the MATLAB programming language and environment, this automated software algorithm assesses every image in an acquired data set, using edges found within each image, and in many cases eliminating the need for dedicated edge targets. SRVT automatically identifies  high-contrast, uniform edges and calculates the MTF and RER of each image, and when possible, within sections of an image, so that the variation of spatial resolution characteristics across the image can be analyzed. The automated algorithm is capable of quickly verifying the spatial resolution quality of all images within a data set, enabling the appropriate use of those images in a number of applications.\r\nThe SRVT has been validated against traditional techniques using IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery.",

      "description": "The IVHM Project in the Aviation Safety Program has funded research in electrical power system (EPS) health management. This problem domain contains both discrete and continuous behavior, and thus is directly relevant for the hybrid diagnostic tool HyDE. In FY2007 work was performed to expand the HyDE diagnosis model of the ADAPT system. The work completed resulted in a HyDE model with the capability to diagnose five times the number of ADAPT components than was previously tested. The expanded diagnosis model passed a corresponding set of new ADAPT fault injection scenario tests with no incorrect faults reported. The time required for the HyDE diagnostic system to isolate the fault varied widely between tests; this variance was reduced by tuning of the HyDE input parameters. These results and other diagnostic design tradeoffs are discussed. Finally, possible future improvements for both the HyDE diagnostic model and HyDE itself are presented.",

This standard is used to support the exchange of component models for complex system simulations throughout Europe and the United States. Trick simulations are used all across NASA for simulations that support human spaceflight activities. However, until now, there were no means to use FMI based models in a Trick based simulation or a method for providing Trick based models that were FMI compliant. This software provides implementation software to do both. There are two principal components to the software: A C based software implementation for wrapping Trick based C models that provide an FMI compliant interface; A collection of C++ classes that can be used in a Trick based simulation to use an FMI compliant model (FMU).",

It extends the existing open source software's capabilities and functionality by bookkeeping more detailed information on internal data structures, as well as ensuring the consistency of mathematical conventions used by subroutines that are part of a third-party tool called ASOS as part of the modification. Additional convergence criteria have also been included, as well as the possibility for establishing additional constraints and modelling paradigms.",

      "description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",

      "description": "This software retrieves a set of atmospheric/surface/instrument parameters from a simultaneous fit to spectra from multiple absorption bands. The software uses an iterative, non-linear retrieval technique (optimal estimation). After the retrieval process has converged, the software performs an error analysis. The products of the software include all quantities needed to understand the information content of the measurement, its uncertainty, and its dependence on interfering atmospheric properties. Spectra from ground-based or space-based measurement with arbitrary observation geometry can be analyzed. The retrieved parameters can be chosen from a large set of atmospheric (e.g., volume mixing ratio of gases or aerosol optical depth), surface (e.g., Lambertian reflection), and instrument (e.g., spectral shift or instrument line shape parameters) parameters. The software uses an accurate, state-of-the-art, multiple-scattering radiative transfer code combined with an efficient polarization approximation to simulate measured spectra. The software enables fast and highly accurate simulations of broad spectral ranges by an optional parallelization of the frequency processing in the radiative transfer model. The framework was written with flexibility in mind. New algorithms and instruments are added by creating additional classes that implement the defined interfaces. Bindings are available for both Python and Lua.",
