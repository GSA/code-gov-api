These sets of indicators are capable of transmitting and translating process performance, feedstock, utility, equipment, and output information into a quantifiable sustainability measurement scale. In addition, each indicator is mathematically defined, thus emphasizing realistic usage, and connecting the mathematical formulas for the indicators with their respective data requirements. \r\n \r\nGREENSCOPE can be applied to an entire process, to a piece of equipment or process unit, or at the investigatory bench scale. This versatility allows for a direct comparison between several processes manufacturing the same product but employing different raw materials, reaction processes, separation technologies, or producing different byproducts. In addition, the designer or the researcher can implement this methodology to evaluate the sustainability performance either before or after making process modifications. This resulting sustainability assessment describes quantifiably how well the system under consideration makes use of mass and energy inputs to manufacture a valuable product, at the same time meeting social and environmental needs, all the while maximizing its economic benefit.\r\n  \r\nCurrently, the GREENSCOPE Microsoft Excel version software tool is under clearance in STICS. The JAVA version has been QA approved. A new standalone and web-based version is under development in GitHub (https://github.com/USEPA/greenscope).",

PiSCES utilizes distributional information obtained from Nature Serve, the USGS, and the Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America for over 1,000 native and non-native freshwater fish species. In addition to these geographic distributions, users of PiSCES can filter potential fish assemblages based on species rarity, stream size preferences (as measured by mean stream width), and genera-specific occurrence envelopes for a variety of physicochemical stream properties (pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, watershed area, mean width, depth, and slope). For a user-specified total number of fishes in the stream reach, PiSCES will create an abundance distribution for the posited community using a size spectrum approach that relates abundance to maximum body size. The PiSCES interface allows users to readily access its database to see ancillary characteristics of each species, such as habitat preferences (e.g., if the species prefers riffles, runs, or pools, sand or gravel substrate, etc.) and HUC-based distribution maps. PiSCES has been used in conjunction with an integrated environmental modeling system to simulate dynamics of stream fish communities in the Coal River, WV watershed.",
