The CAIVRS web interface is part of HUD’s F17C/FHA Connection, which is an Internet-based application.   Originally, CAIVRS automated screening was done only through a touch-tone telephone system using a succession of voice response units (VRUs). CAIVRS was created in 1988 for the Office of Housing to check the credit worthiness of applicants for FHA insured loans. Title 31, United States Code, Section 3720B bars “delinquent Federal debtors from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance guarantees.” In 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that all Federal Credit agencies prescreen all applicants for non-delinquency in Federal debt, through a system of shared data, where practical. In 1990, CAIVRS expanded to include delinquent Federal borrower data from agencies other than HUD, including; USDA, VA, SBA, FDIC, and the Departments of Education and Justice.  HUD receives data and has Computer Matching agreements and Interagency Agreements with the following Federal Agencies: 1. USDA - United States Department of Agriculture a. RURAL HOUSING b. FARM SERVICES 2. SBA - Small Business Administration, 3. VA - Veterans Administration, 4. DOED - Department of Education, a. Guaranteed B.

      "description": "The Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) FASS-FHA system is a key component of HUD's overall portfolio assessment system since HUD manages 30,000 multifamily housing projects representing $40B of mortgage insurance or loan risk and $12B of annual project-based subsidies. The FASS-FHA system collects annual project financial statement information to assess the project's financial performance and compliance and has accepted and assessed over 78,000 electronic submissions of Annual Financial Statement (AFS) data since October of 1998. It identifies financial risks and compliance deficiencies in need of loss mitigation or enforcement actions by the Office of Housing (Housing) or Enforcement Center (EC). The financial data collected by REAC, Housing and EC as well as other HUD program offices, is used to assess multifamily properties for non-compliance and poor performance. The automated assessments and on-line analysis provided by FASS-FHA assists HUD's limited program monitoring and enforcement staff in prioritizing review of properties. The FASS-FHA system is responsible for eliminating time consuming and costly clearinghouse collection and manual assessment efforts previously performed by HUD contractors and field staff. FASS-FHA provides REAC with: · the ability to accept electronic submissions of AFS data for the multifamily portfolio; · automated compliance checks, financial performance assessments, and referral recommendations that allow prioritization of reviews; · Inbox and Selection Criteria screens that allows REAC analysts and Multifamily Housing (MFH) Project Managers to view AFS data and assessment results for each AFS data submission and facilitates workload management; · the ability for owners or their authorized agents to electronically submit administrative requests associated with the AFS data submission process (extensions, waivers, resubmission requests); · the ability to process administrative requests on-line and communicate the decision via an industry Status Box; the ability to automatically determine and track properties for which an AFS data submission is overdue; · the ability for REAC managers to QA referrals; · the ability to refer the IPA for submissions to QASS.",

      "description": "In June 1997, HUD announced it was embarking the most far-reaching and ambitious reform initiatives in its history. The new HUD 2020 Management Reform Plan included, among other changes, the establishment of the Public and Indian Housing - Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC). PIH-REAC is an information-intensive HUD operation that evaluates the performance of field entities managing or owning housing in which the Department has either a financial interest or a statutory monitoring obligation. (Note that the majority of these properties are public housing or multifamily properties.) As part of this Enterprise-Wide Strategic Plan, HUD made three decisions that require most significant transformations of the FASS-PH program that have ever been undertaken. One decision is that it will take a quantum leap in its effort to improve the granularity of its monitoring of local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). A second is that it will start using, and eventually migrate all of its stored data to Oracle. Third, it will shift to using an open source, Java-based programming language, often called J2EE (completed). The decision has been made to create a more transparent reporting system that will provide a greater level of granularities at the property level. The objective is to collect expenses and revenues from a Project Based Management (PBM) perspective – specifically by dividing the properties managed by individual Public Housing Agencies/Authorities (PHAs) into more manageable sized groupings called Asset Management Projects (AMPs). To help implement this, HUD will also encourage the creation of a Central Office Cost Center (COCC) for each PHA with more than one AMP. These COCCs (or private management companies) will serve as the vehicle through which a PHA can provide administrative and maintenance services to its AMPs, and through which it can keep an accounting of the expenditures for those services (conversion to AMP completed). As a result of these changes, the FASS-PH software will have to be changed to capture, evaluate and grade the new financial information being submitted by the PHAs. This will require a number of new financial data input screens for PHAs, evaluation screens for Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) Staff, and the back-end processes that drive these and other submission-scoring operations.

      "description": "The Lender Assessment SubSystem (LASS) was initially developed by the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC). REAC developed the Lender Assessment Subsystem (LASS) to automate and improve the process of capturing annual, audited financial and compliance data for HUD approved Non-supervised mortgagees and loan correspondents. The system currently resides under the purview of HUD’s Single Family Housing Office of Lender Activities. The LASS System is a web-based application that collects and assesses financial data from approximately 7,000 Non-supervised Loan Correspondents and Mortgagees. LASS provides FHA personnel with real-time access to risk management information associated with lender and issuer activities related to over $700 billion of mortgage insurance in-force and mortgage-backed securities. The LASS system provides HUD with a comprehensive tool to identify and measure potential risk factors posed by lenders to the insured portfolio. LASS assists in addressing the material weakness identified in FHA’s FY2000 audited financial statement which states that “FHA must continue to place more emphasis on early warning and loss prevention for single family insured mortgages. It also addresses concerns expressed in an Inspector General (IG) report, which cited FHA for being lax on lender reviews. The LASS system complies with the requirements of OMB Circulars A-123, “Internal Control Systems” and A-127, “Financial Management Systems.” Additionally, it addresses the 24 CFR Part 5, UFRS, Subpart H, Section 5.801 (b) which was amended to state: “Entities (or individuals) to which this subpart is applicable must provide to HUD, on an annual basis, such financial information as required by HUD.”",

MASS centralizes the public housing management risk analysis process, relieves Field Offices of the burdens associated with data entry and analysis, and provides REAC with a comprehensive tool to monitor, review, score and track a PHA?s management performance. PHAs will submit their management indicator information directly into MASS where the data will be automatically scored. This allows HUD to target risks while making the best use of the Department?s limited resources. Management assessment is the third of four indicators to be assessed under the PHAS rule issued to reflect the operations of the REAC and includes: · Vacant unit turnaround time · Capital Fund · Work Orders · Annual inspection of dwelling units and systems · Security · Economic self-sufficiency MASS is currently broken up into 6 implementation releases. Releases 1, 2, 3 and 4 have been previously implemented into production. Releases 5 and 6 carry all SDM phases of the MASS initiative into FY 2002. Release 5 was developed to support the REAC invalidation process, improve the evaluative nature of the current management indicators, enhance navigation and improve the current pages with updated and/or new information. Release 6 has focused on the development of new management reporting functions and the improvement of existing reporting functions.

The intent is to make better use of the disparate data that HUD already possesses within its independent legacy systems and databases, as well as of data that HUD has purchased. • Data is cleansed and the format is standardized. • Data is loaded into a data warehouse. • OPIIS calculates a risk assessment score for each property and ranks each property as high, moderate, and low risk. • Provides an Integrated Risk Assessment (IRA) score derived from combined financial, physical inspection, default/delinquency, and management review data. • Recalculates the IRA whenever any scoring component is updated. • Provides the ability to produce risk analysis reports of individual properties as well as by HUD Hub or Field Office. • Is used by field office asset managers, appraisers, and underwriters to more accurately focus their default prevention, loss mitigation, and other risk management activities, and to prioritize their workloads so as to as to address the highest risk properties first. • Formats financial data into year-over-year comparison reports for analyzing trends. • OPIIS is fully compliant with the HUD Enterprise Architecture model. • Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), through a business intelligence tool, provides data mining/analysis, time series, and trend analysis views. The business intelligence tool is a multidimensional data store designed from the outset to provide quick access to pre-summarized data from vast amounts of detailed data. • Allows users to benchmark the performance of a given multifamily property to its market and to the performance of a group of peer properties. • Allows users to view historical property performance over time. • Allows users to view, graph, export, and save customizable reports and graphs. • Allows users to portray data onto geographical maps to view the geographical distribution and concentrations of risk. • Allows users to manage credit and operational risk as well as the risk of loss of affordable housing units. • Allows users to prevent defaults and mitigate losses.",

Objectives for IOD are that it will: • Become a central resource for PD&R to analyze emerging trends, issues, and solutions. • Spur HUD HQ, field, and regional offices to engage with innovations occurring within their jurisdiction–improving participation, a sense of ownership, connectivity, and morale across the agency. • Engage domestic and international innovators from public, private, and social sectors in sharing best practices and models • Generate philanthropic interest, collaborations and/or investment. • Be a meaningful external engagement tool, demonstrating HUD values new approaches and innovative practices in fulfilling its mission. The four components of IOD include: 1. An online submission form and innovations database: Anyone can submit innovations (HUD staff, local governments, multi-lateral organizations, non-profits, or the general public) to IOD though a straightforward submission form. Thereafter, an internal IOD committee will clear submissions for publishing based on established and OGC-approved criteria. Once cleared, innovations will populate a searchable database that can be filtered by HUD goals, major housing and urban development themes, geography, and/or innovation type. 2. Review and Edit Submitted Innovations An internal IOD committee will review all submitted innovations to validate text and photographs of the submissions. This system will be available internally to HUD staff. 3. Featured Innovation: The IOD committee will select key innovations to feature on the HUD.gov homepage slideshow and HUDuser.org, in addition to the Innovation of the Day landing page. These featured innovations will change/rotate on a weekly basis, enabling us to elevate specific innovations. For example, one week we may want to feature innovations related to homelessness, while another week sustainable communities. Additionally, featured innovations will be shared through social media, emails, and partner sites—the viral nature helping to fuel the overall initiative. 4. Trend Analysis and Dashboard Tool Anyone will be able to query the submitted innovations. Internally, these submissions will be reviewed by an internal IOD committee before it is available externally.",

System generated E-mail reminder messages will be sent to employees and supervisors when they have missed deadlines for the entry and approval of T&A records.

The HECM program allows seniors to convert the equity in their home to cover monthly or unforeseen expenses by means of getting monthly payments and/or lump-sum distributions that are not repaid until the home is sold. The home is sold upon the borrowers' death or the loan is repaid via other means, which results in termination of the FHA Insurance. While the loan is active, disbursements are added to the outstanding balance, along with interest and other applicable fees, up to the calculated limit based on the borrowers' age and the property value. The borrower does not make payments as in a conventional loan, but the loan is repaid either to the lender by sale of the property or other re-payment method, or to HUD if the case has become an Assigned Note. An Assigned Note happens when the outstanding balance reaches 98% or more of its limit, at which time, FHA takes over the servicing of the loan, and pays a Claim to the lender to cover their outlays.",

The HIAMS Reporting System has three distinct environments – a development environment, a user acceptance testing (UAT) environment and the production environment. The development environment is used by the Supporting Contracting team to create new functionality and conduct unit testing. After components are developed and tested by Supporting Contracting Team, they are promoted to the UAT environment. The UAT environment is used to stage the developed enhancements for testing by both the contractor team and HUD. Once components have passed UAT testing, they are promoted to the production environment. The production environment is used by the HUD community to run reports, view dashboards and perform ad hoc queries. Using these multiple environments, the Supproting Contracting Team and HUD can effectively manage the development of new functionality within the HIAMS Reporting System, enhance existing functionality, test new features and components and deploy the overall changes into production for the user community.

These goals will help improve the agency’s ability to accurately quantify budgetary data resources, measure program effectiveness, and scrupulously justify the agency s budget formulations and requests. By aligning current and future AH processes, HUD aims to simplify business operations and maximize investment returns with business-driven, service-oriented solutions that employ shared and standardized technology. NGMS will provide an integrated, seamless and singular view of financial and program data used to make real-time business decisions, currently warehoused in disparate data sources. The modernization of affordable housing program data through NGMS will provide HUD executives, Congressional authorizers and appropriators, OMB, public housing agencies, and other stakeholders an enhanced view of HUD s financial accountability. With NGMS' accurate financial data and automated processes, HUD personnel will be able to reduce improper payment errors by identifying operating costs, reserves, and subsidy payment anomalies. Once implemented, NGMS will provide staff with a new set of monitoring, oversight and analysis tools to ensure that allocated federal funds are used efficiently to assist affordable housing participants. NGMS will build project modules across four dimensions: (1) HUD Operations - creating a single point of access to data and key information to reduce HUD s administrative burden; (2) Financial management - developing an automated and more accurate process of budget formulation based on real-time data to reduce errors in budget forecasting; (3) Partner Operations - providing HUD partners with a single point of access to data that will allow them to better serve their customers and operate more efficiently; and (4) Business support - expanding the access and use of the NGMS IT advancements to the HUD enterprise level.",

The REST API will enforce authentication through white listed IP addresses. The traffic will be completely encrypted using TLS1.1 or above protocol. HPCS will post data collection request to Retpmt.cfm to obtain complete transaction data for the Agency ID. Retpmt.cfm will return payment information to HPCS. HPCS will transform the data received for OCI service to the format required by the TCS service. In the payload please note that the TCS APP ID to be used corresponds one to one with the existing application names that are being used. HPCS will assign a unique transaction ID to each transaction and in case of a batch of transactions to the whole batch also. This ID and the agency tracking id received from FHAC will be returned back with a status of “received”. The transaction is pushed into a queue and then HPCS dequeuer will check the status of payment in its own database if it has already been previously received or processed, if not it makes the TCS call to pay.gov and processes the payment and obtains the status. .",
