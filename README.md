## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies. And it will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

This repository is home to the code powering code.gov. To learn more about the project, check out the main [Code.gov project README](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-pm/blob/master/README.md)

## Installation

Please install the following dependencies before running this project...

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)

Once node is installed, install the local npm dependencies...

`cd code-gov-api && npm install`

## Running

This project uses elasticsearch to store code repositories. As such, it is necessary to run an indexing process which will populate an elasticsearch index. Make sure that elasticsearch is running, then

`npm run index`

After the indexing process runs, you can fire up the server by running npm start...

`npm start`

The API should now be accessible via the browser (or curl) at [http://localhost:3001/api/0.1/](http://localhost:3001/api/0.1/).
